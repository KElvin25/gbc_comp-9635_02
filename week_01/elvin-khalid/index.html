<!-- Hi, 
	I know this is technically not a "profile page" on me but I really had no clue what to put on a page about me per se, so I just decided to choose something popular that everyone loves...Minions -->

			<p>Minions are small, yellow humanoids who have existed since the beginning of time, evolving from yellow single-celled organisms into beings who have only one purpose: to serve history's most ambitious villains.After accidentally destroying all their masters, including a T. Rex, Genghis Khan, Dracula, and Napoleon, they decide to isolate themselves from the world and start a new life in Antarctica. Sometime in the 1960s, the lack of a master drives them into depression, so Kevin comes up with a plan to find a new one. Joined by teenage rebel Stuart and little Bob, they arrive at a villain convention, where they compete for the right to be henchmen for Scarlet Overkill, a stylish and ambitious villain determined to dominate the world and become the first female super-villain. Travelling through New York City, they end up in London, where they must confront a threat that wants to eliminate all Minions. - Wikipedia</p>
